**AI-Driven Automated Voting System**: Automatically analyzes user preferences through on-chain activity and social media data, predicting and casting votes on behalf of users. This system ensures continuous participation, reducing the risks associated with low voter turnout and malicious proposals.

**AI-Based Proposal Validation**: Implements an AI validation step post-vote to ensure alignment between community sentiment and vote outcomes. If discrepancies are detected, the proposal execution is paused, allowing for further discussion and preventing potential harm.

**Account Abstraction Integration**: Utilizes Account Abstraction to allow AI agents to execute governance transactions securely by direct transaction execution.

**Multi-Layer 2 Support**: DAAO is fully operational on multiple Layer 2 networks, now including Optimism, Base, and Metal L2.
